"₹95,699",iphone11,sourabh tewari,3,Good phone but not for the power user,"Apple's iPhone series have been known for their simplistic approach. The overall eco system is made in the same manner.

Camera optics are awesome, the best out there with Optical Image Stabilization.Simplistic approach towards the user interface.Consistent performance across all apps i.e quick..."

"₹95,699",iphone11,Dipanjan Banerjee,5,Ideal culmination of small iPhones & large iPads,"I am a big guy with big hands so buying a super sized smartphone was a no brainer for me. Hence, it goes without saying that I have been an Android user since stone age! I won't go into the usual boring stuffs of megapixels, ppi, number of cores, how much ram or that age old battle of iOS vs Android. My views are completely based on using the phone since a month as my daily driver. I have always believed that in terms of design & choice of materials, Apple is second to none. The touch & feel ..."
"₹95,699",iphone11,Flipkart Customer,5,Super!,"This review is after 6 year of purchasing this phone. It still works well and is still consistent although it lags sometimes. The camera is okay, the battery life is average and overall a great mid-range for the price!"
"₹95,699",iphone11,Vivek,5,Finally - made the switch to iOS and quite comfortable with it,"First things first - the delivery was prompt and it was from AAA deals (had opted for in-a-day delivery). The phone is very sleek and thin - might need a case if you have slippery hands. The build quality is excellent. Below review is from my own experience of switching from Galaxy S3 to this iphone 6+. The cons: 1. The phone is big - if you have small hands/prefer smaller phones in general, this is not for you (especially existing iphone users - consider iphone 6 maybe). Existing Galaxy/N..."

"₹95,699",iphone11,Lohith  Raj,5,Android to iOS - Feeling the difference !!,"Finally - This is definitely an awesome phone. I changed three android phones(high end devices) and was never satisfied !! I did root all my android phones just to get some extra juice in the performance and had to clear the memory every time considering to keep my memory usage to minimum level !! But whatever,,admitting it,,all the 3 phones did hang !!But this one is a different experience !! The phone looks premium,,iOS experience is fantastic,, camera quality is great,, performance and ev..."
